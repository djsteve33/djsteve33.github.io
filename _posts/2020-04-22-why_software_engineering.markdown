So, why did I decide to study Software Engineering? Well, I'm entering this world of Software Engineering at Flatiron in hopes of learning new things and maybe even solve some of the world's business problems. I have a curious and educational background, which has led me to question how things work. Plus, Flatiron has a proven track record of generating successful graduates who get hired by great companies with great jobs.

I told myself that I would never go back  to school again after being a career college student. But, I keep doing things that I told myself that I would never do again. That could be good or that could be bad. Studying Software Engineering at Flatiron is going to be quite the adventure. But, I look forward to the challenge. They say you should never stop learning. That's me. I never stop learning.
